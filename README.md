# Runner's High

Runner's high is a full stack CRUD application in which users can sign up, log in, add, and track their favorite running shoes. I created this app because I am an avid runner and I needed something clean and user friendly to track mileage on my running shoes.

## Getting started

## Future Enhancements

In the future I would like to add another model to the app so that users can add their runs and track their daily mileage/routes.
